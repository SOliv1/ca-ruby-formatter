CONTROL FLOW IN RUBY
How It Works
You may have noticed that the kinds of programs weâ€™ve written so far in Ruby arenâ€™t very flexible. Sure, they can take user input, but they always produce the same result based on that input; they donâ€™t change their behavior in reaction to the environment (the collection of all variables and their values that exist in the program at a given time).

Control flow gives us the flexibility weâ€™re looking for. We can select different outcomes depending on information the user types, the result of a computation, or the value returned by another part of the program.

Instructions
1.
Check out the code in the editor. Thereâ€™s some new syntax there, but weâ€™ll bet you can guess what it does. Click Run to see the program in action! (Go ahead and give Ruby an integerâ€”that is, a positive or negative number with no decimal bit.)
